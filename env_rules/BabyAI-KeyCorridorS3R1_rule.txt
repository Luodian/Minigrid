Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to pick up the ball that is behind a locked door, requiring first finding and collecting the matching key. The environment is a 3-column grid layout with room_size=3 and num_rows=1, consisting of a left column (key location), middle column (corridor), and right column (locked room with ball), with rooms connected via doors. The red triangular agent starts in the middle corridor facing right. Behind the locked door in the right column is a ball, and a matching colored key is placed in one of the left rooms. Walls and locked doors block movement and sight, but the agent can toggle doors with matching keys. The agent must find the key, navigate to the locked door, unlock it, and pick up the ball. Success is achieved by picking up the ball.
