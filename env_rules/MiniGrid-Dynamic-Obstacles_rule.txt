Environment Rule Description

- Video Prompt:
    - Render a top-down grid (5x5, 6x6, 8x8, or 16x16) with gray outer walls. A red triangular agent starts at a fixed top-left position or random position (Random variants) facing right. The goal is a green square at the bottom-right corner. Moving ball obstacles (colored spheres) are scattered throughout the room and move randomly each turn. The agent must navigate to the goal while avoiding collision with moving obstacles. Contact with obstacles terminates the episode with penalty. Show the agent carefully moving around dynamically shifting obstacles to reach the goal.
