MiniGrid-SimpleCrossing Environment Rule Description

- Video Prompt:
    - Render a top-down 9x9 or 11x11 grid with gray outer walls. A red triangular agent starts in the top-left corner facing right. The goal is a green square at the bottom-right corner. Multiple horizontal and vertical wall barriers cross the room, each with a single opening (gap) that allows passage. The agent must navigate through the wall openings to reach the goal. Unlike lava variants, walls simply block movement without terminating the episode. Show the agent navigating through the wall maze using the openings to reach the goal.

- Rule Summary:
    - Objective: Navigate to the green goal square by finding openings in wall barriers that cross the room.
    - Environment: Square grid (9x9 or 11x11) with outer walls, multiple horizontal and vertical wall barriers with single openings.
    - Key mechanics: Success by reaching the goal.
