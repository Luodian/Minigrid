Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to open a specific door as indicated in the mission text (e.g., "open the red door" or "open the door"). The environment has various layouts depending on variant - single room with 4 doors (OpenDoor), simple 2-room setup (OpenRedDoor), or multi-room maze (Open), with all doors initially closed but unlocked. The red triangular agent starts in a room with multiple colored doors. The agent must navigate to the specific door indicated by the mission and use the toggle action to open it.
