Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to pick up the colored ball behind a locked door by first finding and collecting the matching key. The environment is a 3-column, 2-row grid layout with room_size=3, forming a total grid approximately 5x3. The layout consists of left rooms (2 rows) where keys are located, a middle corridor (connected vertically), and right rooms (2 rows) with one containing a locked door. The red triangular agent starts in the middle corridor facing right. Behind the locked door is a colored ball, and a matching colored key is placed randomly in one of the left rooms. The agent must explore the left rooms to find the key, navigate to the locked door in a right room, unlock it, and pick up the ball. Success is achieved by picking up the target ball.
