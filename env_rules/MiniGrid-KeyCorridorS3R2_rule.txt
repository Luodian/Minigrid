MiniGrid-KeyCorridorS3R2 Environment Rule Description

- Video Prompt:
    - Render a top-down grid with gray outer walls arranged in a 3-column, 2-row room layout (total 5x3 grid). A red triangular agent starts in the middle corridor facing right. The layout has left rooms (2 rows), a middle corridor (connected vertically), and right rooms (2 rows) with one containing a locked door. Behind the locked door is a colored ball, and a matching colored key is placed randomly in one of the left rooms. The agent must explore the left rooms to find the key, navigate to the locked door in a right room, unlock it, and pick up the ball. Show the agent exploring, collecting the key, unlocking the door, and retrieving the target object.
