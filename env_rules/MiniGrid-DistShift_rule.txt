MiniGrid-DistShift Environment Rule Description

- Video Prompt:
    - Render a top-down 9x7 grid with gray outer walls. A red triangular agent starts in the top-left corner facing right. The goal is a green square in the top-right corner. Two horizontal lava strips block the path, positioned to create navigation challenges (the second strip's row varies by variant).
