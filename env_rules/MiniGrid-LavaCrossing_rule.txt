Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to navigate to the green goal square while avoiding deadly lava rivers that have single crossing points. The environment is a square grid (9x9 or 11x11) with outer walls and multiple horizontal and vertical lava rivers (red hazard stripes) crossing the room, each with a single safe crossing point (gap). The red triangular agent starts in the top-left corner facing right, and the goal is a green square at the bottom-right corner. Stepping on lava is forbidden and causes immediate death/termination, so the agent must navigate through the safe crossing points while avoiding lava contact. Success is achieved by reaching the goal.
