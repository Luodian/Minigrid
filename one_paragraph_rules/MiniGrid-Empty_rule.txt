Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to navigate to the green goal square in an empty room with no obstacles. The environment is a square grid (5x5, 6x6, 8x8, or 16x16) with outer walls only, where the goal is at the bottom-right corner. The red triangular agent starts at the top-left corner or random position (Random variants) facing right. The room is completely empty with no obstacles between agent and goal, allowing the agent to navigate directly to the green goal square. Success is achieved by reaching the goal.
