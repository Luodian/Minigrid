Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to navigate to the green goal square while avoiding collision with moving ball obstacles. The environment is a square grid (5x5 to 16x16) with outer walls where the goal is at the bottom-right corner. The red triangular agent starts at a fixed top-left position or random position (Random variants) facing right. Moving ball obstacles (colored spheres) are scattered throughout the room and move randomly each turn. Contact with obstacles terminates the episode with penalty, so the agent must carefully navigate around the dynamically shifting obstacles to reach the goal. Success is achieved by reaching the goal.
