Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to navigate to the green goal square by finding openings in wall barriers that cross the room. The environment is a 9x9 square grid with outer walls and multiple horizontal and vertical wall barriers, each with a single opening (gap) that allows passage. The red triangular agent starts in the top-left corner facing right, and the goal is a green square at the bottom-right corner. Unlike lava variants, walls simply block movement without terminating the episode. The agent must navigate through the wall openings to reach the goal. Success is achieved by reaching the goal.
