Environment Rule Description

In this environment, the objective is to navigate to the single randomly generated object in the room as specified in the mission "go to the {color} {type}". The environment is a single room (4x4, 6x6, or 8x8 grid depending on variant), surrounded by walls with no doors or internal structures. The red triangular agent starts in the room facing right. The room contains one randomly placed object (ball, box, or key) with random color (red, green, blue, purple, yellow, grey). Walls block movement and sight. The agent must navigate to this single target object. Success is achieved by reaching the target object.
